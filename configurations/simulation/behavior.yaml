# general configs
dt: 0.1  # s, length of a simulation time step
replanning_frequency: 3  # time steps, should be set by Planner Interface during initialization

# path_planner configs
dist_between_points: 0.125  # m
stepwise_lane_changes: True  # Insert stepwise lane changes into the initial reference path
preparation_time: 3  # s, time of a static preparation state
goal_time: 2  # s, time of a static goal state
distance_self_intersection: 10 # m, shorten extension of ref path by this if self intersecting

# velocity_planner configs
#min_TTC_to_preceading_vehicle: 3.0
safety_distance_buffer: 2  # s, safety distance to the other car relative to speed
a_max_delta: 0.3  # s, to calculate the maximum acceleration limit over this time period
comfortable_deceleration_rate: 3.4  # m/s^2
zero_velocity_threshold: 0.278  # m/s, slower desired velocities are set to 0

# stop_point configs
default_time_horizon: 2  # s
min_stop_point_dist: 1.4  # m, minimal distance of the stop_point ahead of current position
min_stop_point_time: 1  # s, minimal distance relative to the velocity of the stop_point ahead of current position
standing_obstacle_vel: 1  # m/s, when predicted obstacle is slower, then stop_point is set behind the obstacle with a velocity of 0
